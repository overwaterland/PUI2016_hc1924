#HW6
HW6_assignment1 is done with 10% help of Wang Yao.I worked with Sichen Tang on assignment2. We used the citi bike project from her HW3 assignment to write the report. She completed the Z test. We write the report separetely.

##HW6_Assignment 1
I don't know why my compute can't import packages like geopandas and seaborn. I download the file on my local folder and work on local server. The files aren't in the PUIdata.

# FBB because you are using the wrong kernel! you need to use PUI2016_python2 orPUI2016_python3 kernels. Please talk to the TAs if this is not clear. It should be by now.

# FBB 
the project is flawed in the structure of the report. The analysis may be ok but there are crucial missing pieces, like you never actually show that you take a mean to perform the test or mention that this is a test ot means! please see the comments in the Authorea article
